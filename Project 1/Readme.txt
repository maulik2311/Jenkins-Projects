Important:
This is CI project

Ec2 -->  Jenkis and Git
           
As a architech diagram on ec2 install Jenkins on jenkis configure java and maven.
Why we do this?
Because it will compile the source code

Install Git on Ec2 that will create empty .git directory inside(config) it will save remote repo(with orii) detail.([remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/maulik2311/Standalone_and_web_practice_app.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*) 


GitHub: connect it with repo url and provide branch name where pom.xml is available


Configure properly it will work for sure!!!!
